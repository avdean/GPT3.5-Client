## OpenAI Text Models Frontend Client
This is a fork of my previous project, CGPT-cliebt that allows you to speak to ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) directly via API! ThereÂ´s also no need to run a server and you can simply insert your API key directly in the front end which is stored as state in local storage.

### Features
- Easy to use interface
- Ability to generate new text based on user input
- Ability to define how GPT3.5 responds

### Future Plans
Currently, the frontend client is a simple interface that allows users to generate new text based on OpenAI's models. However, there are plans to make the frontend more configurable and allow users to customize the input and output settings.
I also want to clean up the welcome screen and perhaps include routing in the app.

### Contributions
Contributions to the project are welcome! If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to submit an issue or pull request.
